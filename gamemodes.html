	<h3>Spike Rush</h3></div>

<div class="maintext">
	<p>"In Spike Rush two teams of five players will play against each other, much like the standard matches. Teams are split into an offensive and a <br>defensive side with all players on the offensive team receiving a Spike. Ultimately the game is won by planting and detonating <br>the spike or by killing all players on the opposing team. The first team to win four rounds wins the game."<strong>-esports</strong></p></div>

	<h4>Death Match</h4></div>
	
<div class="maintext">
	<p>"Deathmatch is a mode where you spawn in with nine other players and six minutes to get as many frags as possible. The first player with 30 kills wins the round,<br>  if no one reaches that in the time given, the player with the most kills wins."<strong>-esports</strong></p></div>

	<h5>Replication</h5></div>
	
<div class="maintext">
	<p>"The game mode will throw away the usual team composition of one hero each. Instead, as a group of five, you will vote for which agent you will all play as.<br> The agent with the most votes will be the one who all five players will use, thus meaning you will all play as the same agent."<strong>-GGRECON</strong><p></div>
